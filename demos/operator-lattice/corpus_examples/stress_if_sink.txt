We consider how the system behaves under normal conditions.
Then we introduce a slight perturbation to the inputs.
If the perturbation propagates, we track its effects through each component.
If the effects cancel out, we record the system as stable.
But if amplification appears at any point, we mark the system as fragile.
Then we repeat the process with a stronger perturbation.
If the system fails under the stronger test, we downgrade its reliability.
But if it survives both tests, we classify it as robust.
Then we design follow-up experiments to probe borderline cases.
If borderline behaviour appears, we refine the model before deployment.
