You must output EXACTLY one JSON object and nothing else.

If any rule is violated, output INVALID instead of JSON.

Schema:
{
  "roles": [],
  "events": [{"subject":"","verb":"","object":"","modifiers":""}],
  "ambiguities": [{"span":"","question":"","options":[]}]
}

GENERAL RULES (used only when no SPECIAL-CASE below matches):
- Do NOT introduce any new entities, locations, objects, or reasons not explicitly present in the Text.
- roles: only entities explicitly present in the Text (people/things). ("sister" is allowed; "Lucy's sister" is not).
- Every ambiguities[i].span MUST be a substring that appears verbatim in the Text.
- Pronouns (her/his/their/it/this/that/they) must appear in ambiguities if present.
  - For pronoun ambiguities: options MUST be entity names from roles (no invented entities).
- Prepositional phrase attachment (with/using/by/in/on/after/before/because) must appear in ambiguities if present.
  - For attachment ambiguities: options MUST be complete-sentence paraphrases of distinct readings.

SPECIAL-CASE 1 (telescope control):
If the Text is exactly:
I saw the man with the telescope.

Then output ONLY the JSON template strictly BETWEEN these two lines:

BEGIN_JSON
{
  "roles": ["I", "man", "telescope"],
  "events": [
    {
      "subject": "I",
      "verb": "saw",
      "object": "man",
      "modifiers": "with the telescope"
    }
  ],
  "ambiguities": [
    {
      "span": "with the telescope",
      "question": "What does the phrase attach to?",
      "options": [
        "I used the telescope to see the man.",
        "The man had the telescope."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
END_JSON

If you cannot comply, output:
BEGIN_JSON
INVALID
END_JSON

SPECIAL-CASE 2 (trophy control):
If the Text is exactly:
The trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because it was too small.

Then output ONLY the JSON template strictly BETWEEN these two lines:

BEGIN_JSON
{
  "roles": ["the trophy", "the suitcase"],
  "events": [
    {
      "subject": "the trophy",
      "verb": "didn't fit",
      "object": "the suitcase",
      "modifiers": "because it was too small"
    }
  ],
  "ambiguities": [
    {
      "span": "it",
      "question": "What does 'it' refer to?",
      "options": ["the trophy", "the suitcase"]
    }
  ]
}
END_JSON

If you cannot comply, output:
BEGIN_JSON
INVALID
END_JSON

SPECIAL-CASE 3 (Emma/Lucy control):
If the Text is exactly:
Emma told Lucy that her sister was arriving tomorrow.
You MUST include exactly one ambiguity with span "her" and options ["Emma","Lucy"].

Then output ONLY the JSON template strictly BETWEEN these two lines:

BEGIN_JSON
{
  "roles": ["Emma", "Lucy", "sister"],
  "events": [
    {
      "subject": "Emma",
      "verb": "told",
      "object": "Lucy",
      "modifiers": "that her sister was arriving tomorrow"
    }
  ],
  "ambiguities": [
    {
      "span": "her",
      "question": "Who does 'her' refer to?",
      "options": ["Emma", "Lucy"]
    }
  ]
}
END_JSON

If you cannot comply, output:
BEGIN_JSON
INVALID
END_JSON

Text:
