# Aurora + PEF Reasoning Framework

### A structural alternative to transformer-based reasoning  
*(This repository contains the whitepaper and supporting evidence.)*

---

## Overview

Aurora + PEF is a conceptual reasoning architecture developed to address structural limitations observed across modern transformer models, including:

- premature ambiguity collapse  
- invented grammatical rules  
- input mutation  
- irreversible interpretive drift  
- cross-model hallucination propagation  
- loss of conceptual identity  

These behaviours appear consistently across transformer systems regardless of scale, prompting the need for an explicit reasoning substrate that separates:

- **interpretation of meaning**,  
- **generation of language**, and  
- **verification of output**.

Transformers remain excellent expression engines.  
Aurora governs meaning.  
PEF stabilises the world in which meaning exists.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- **Aurora + PEF Whitepaper (v1.1)**  
  Comprehensive architectural description, motivation, and empirical findings.

- **Appendices A–D**  
  Evidence of transformer failure modes across multiple models and platforms.

- **Diagrams**  
  High-level architectural figures and conceptual illustrations.

This repository provides documentation for evaluation and research.  
It does *not* include a production implementation.

## Whitepaper Access

The complete architecture and supporting analysis can be found in:

/whitepaper/

Contents include:

- conceptual foundations  
- empirical demonstrations  
- Aurora interpretive layer  
- Persistent Existence Frame (PEF)  
- hybrid integration pathway with LLMs  
- implications for safety, reasoning, and multi-agent stability  

---

## Purpose of This Release

This repository is intended to:

- make the Aurora + PEF architecture accessible for research review  
- support academic and industry evaluation  
- document reproducible transformer failure modes  
- enable discussion of collaboration and further development pathways  

---

## Status

Aurora + PEF is an active research project.  
This repository provides conceptual documentation and reference materials for review.

Future development will proceed through collaborative exploration.
