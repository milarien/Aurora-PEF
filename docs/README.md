# Documentation Overview

This directory contains the **conceptual, architectural, and evidentiary**
materials for the Aurora + PEF reasoning framework.

The documents here are not meant to be read linearly.
They serve different purposes and audiences, which are outlined below.

---

## Start Here: Core Argument

If you are new to the architecture, begin with the following:

1. **Research Abstract**  
   High-level problem framing and contribution.  
   → `Research-Abstract.md`

2. **Executive Summary**  
   Condensed explanation of the architectural claim.  
   → `Executive-Summary.md`

3. **Aurora Architecture Overview**  
   Conceptual structure of Aurora + PEF.  
   → `Aurora-Architecture-Overview.md`

---

## Architectural Components

These documents describe the core mechanisms of the system:

- **Primitive Operators**  
  Explicit compositional operators (WE, THEN, WHILE, UNTIL, BECAUSE).  
  → `primitives.md`

- **Persistent Existence Frame (PEF)**  
  Non-temporal substrate for persistent conceptual state.  
  → `pef.md`

---

## Failure Analysis

### **Taxonomy**
A systematic classification of architectural failure modes observed in
transformer-based reasoning systems under incomplete information.

This taxonomy explains *why* the failures demonstrated in the demos occur,
and how they cluster mechanistically.

→ `Taxonomy/`

---

## Evidence and Transcripts

Supporting empirical material, including model transcripts and test runs,
used to validate the failure taxonomy and architectural claims.

These materials are **supporting evidence**, not introductory reading.

→ `Evidence/Transcripts/`

## Review Notes

- **FOR_REVIEWERS.md**  
  Guidance for reviewers evaluating the claims and evidence in this repository.

## Website Assets

The following files support the GitHub Pages site and are not part of the
conceptual documentation:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `images/`

They can be ignored unless you are working on the website itself.
