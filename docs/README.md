# docs/ — Aurora + PEF Documentation

This folder contains the **core documentation** for Aurora + PEF.

Not everything here is meant to be read in one pass.
Some files are conceptual documentation; others exist only to render the GitHub Pages site.

---

## Start Here (recommended order)

1. **Architecture Overview**  
   → `01_Aurora-Architecture-Overview.md`

2. **Executive Summary**  
   → `02_Executive-Summary.md`

3. **Research Abstract**  
   → `03_Research-Abstract.md`

## Foundational Constructs (Do Not Skip)

Aurora + PEF is defined by two non-negotiable foundations.
Nothing in this repository makes sense without them.

1. **Persistent Existence Frame (PEF)**  
   A non-temporal substrate in which conceptual identity and meaning persist.
   PEF is what allows ambiguity, refusal, and continuity without time indexing.  
   → `pef.md`

2. **Compositional Primitive Operators**  
   Explicit operators (WE, THEN, WHILE, UNTIL, BECAUSE) that govern how meaning is
   constructed, linked, and collapsed.  
   These are not linguistic constructs; they are reasoning operators.  
   → `primitives.md`

## Review Guidance

- **FOR_REVIEWERS.md**  
  Notes for reviewers evaluating claims, evidence, and scope boundaries.

---

## Evidence and Failure Analysis

These live in subfolders under `docs/`:

- **Taxonomy/**  
  Architectural failure modes (minimal witness scenarios).  
  Start here inside the folder: `Taxonomy/README.md`

- **Evidence/Transcripts/**  
  Raw model transcripts supporting the taxonomy and empirical claims.

---

## Website Files (plumbing)

The following files exist to render the GitHub Pages site and are **not** part of
the conceptual documentation:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`

If you are reading the architecture: ignore these.
If you are editing the website: these are the entry points.
